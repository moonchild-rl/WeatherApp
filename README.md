# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a simple GUI for checking meteorological data at a location.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyQt5 and requests (if not already installed).

```bash
pip install PyQt5 requests
```
or if using a Venv:

```bash
pip --require-virtualenv install PyQt5 requests
```
or using the requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Create an [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) (it's free and easy).
2. Under your profile's [API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) you should now find your personal key (might take a couple of minutes to be active).
3. Copy and paste your key into the file called **API_Key_File.txt**
4. Run the python program main.py.
   
```python
python3 main.py
```
